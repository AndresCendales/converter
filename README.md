There is no need to setup  any env variable, because there are declared in the docker-compose file.


### Deploy production

#### AWS Deployment
The deploy is running in aws in different ec2 machines.
All the code related with the system is in the repository, but each machine runs differents containers:
```shell
# Webserver
cd /usr/src/app/ folder #  Move to the path were the files are allocated
docker-compose -f production-webserver.yml up --build # Start the webserver container
```

```shell
# Worker
cd /usr/src/app/ #  Move to the path were the files are allocated
docker-compose -f prod-sqs-worker.yml up --build # Start the worker, broker container
```

#### Heroku Deployment
Run the script named deploy-heroku.sh in the root of the project.
```shell
chmod +x ./deploy-heroku.sh
./deploy-heroku.sh
```



## Test production
For load testing we disable the slack notifications, please run the following command into the web server: 
```shell
cd /usr/src/app/ #  Move to the path were the files are allocated
docker-compose -f prod-sqs-worker.yml up -f production-webserver.test.yml -d --build # Start the webserver         
```
The production-webserver.test.yml set the env variables into test mode app.
